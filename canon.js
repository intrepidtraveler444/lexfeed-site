    title:'Padfield v Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food [1968] UKHL 1',
    court:'House of Lords',
    facts:'South-east milk producers complained about the regional price differential set under the Milk Marketing Scheme. The statute said the Minister "may" refer such complaints to a committee of investigation; the Minister refused to refer, partly for fear of political embarrassment.',
    judgment:'The House of Lords held the refusal unlawful and ordered the Minister to consider the complaint according to law, rejecting the idea that the discretion was unfettered.',
    ratio:'A statutory discretion, however widely framed, must be exercised to promote the policy and objects of the Act — ascertained by construing the statute as a whole. Using a discretion to frustrate that policy, or for an extraneous purpose, is unlawful and reviewable.',

    title:'Fearn & Ors v Board of Trustees of the Tate Gallery [2023] UKSC 4',
    court:'UK Supreme Court',
    facts:'Residents of glass-walled flats next to Tate Modern were overlooked by hundreds of thousands of visitors using the gallery’s public viewing platform, who could see directly into their living spaces and frequently photographed them. The residents sued in private nuisance.',
    judgment:'The Supreme Court held (3:2) that the visual intrusion was an actionable private nuisance and allowed the appeal, reversing the courts below.',
    ratio:'Private nuisance can extend to overlooking where there is a substantial interference with the ordinary use and enjoyment of land. The test is whether the defendant’s own use of its land is a common and ordinary use, judged by the locality; a claimant is not required to take defensive self-help measures (such as blinds) to avoid an abnormal intrusion.',

    title:'Guest & Anor v Guest [2022] UKSC 27',
    court:'UK Supreme Court',
    facts:'A son worked for decades at low wages on the family farm relying on his parents’ repeated assurances that he would inherit a substantial share of it. After the relationship broke down he was effectively disinherited, and he claimed proprietary estoppel.',
    judgment:'The Supreme Court (3:2) upheld the estoppel and clarified the correct approach to the remedy, allowing the parents’ appeal only on the form of relief.',
    ratio:'The purpose of relief for proprietary estoppel is to remedy the unconscionability of going back on a promise — normally by satisfying the claimant’s expectation. The court may award a lesser remedy where fulfilling the expectation would be out of all proportion to the detriment suffered, and must allow for accelerated receipt where the benefit is given early.',

    title:'Sweet v Parsley [1969] UKHL 1',
    court:'House of Lords',
    facts:'Miss Sweet owned a farmhouse which she sublet to lodgers and rarely visited. Cannabis was smoked on the premises by tenants, without her knowledge or participation. She was charged under the Dangerous Drugs Act 1965 with being "concerned in the management" of premises used for the purpose of smoking cannabis.',
    judgment:'The House of Lords allowed her appeal, holding that the offence required mens rea. The prosecution had failed to prove any knowledge of or participation in the drug use on her part.',
    ratio:'Parliament is presumed not to intend to make a person criminally liable for conduct in which they are in no way blameworthy. Whenever a statute creating a criminal offence is silent as to mens rea, the courts should read in a requirement of mental fault unless Parliament has expressly or by necessary implication excluded it. The presumption is particularly strong for "truly criminal" offences as opposed to purely regulatory ones.',

    court:'House of Lords',
    facts:'O\'Neill, an employee of Phillips\' company, was made a director and given a 25% shareholding. Phillips indicated he was willing to let O\'Neill take over operational management and receive 50% of profits, but no formal agreement was ever made. After a business downturn, Phillips withdrew the informal promises and resumed control. O\'Neill petitioned under s.459 Companies Act 1985 alleging unfair prejudice.',
    judgment:'The House of Lords dismissed the petition. Lord Hoffmann held that withdrawal of negotiations about increasing O\'Neill\'s stake could not constitute unfair prejudice, as no binding obligation had ever been entered into.',
    ratio:'A member of a company may petition for relief from unfair prejudice where the affairs of the company are conducted in a manner that breaches the terms on which it was agreed — including equitable obligations arising from the parties\' relationship — that those affairs would be conducted. The concept of fairness is not to be applied too liberally; a reasonable offer to buy out a petitioner on fair terms will generally render further litigation about conduct unnecessary. Mere withdrawal from exploratory negotiations is not unfairness.',

    title:'Autoclenz Ltd v Belcher [2011] UKSC 41',
    court:'UK Supreme Court',
    facts:'Twenty car valeters engaged by Autoclenz signed written contracts describing them as self-employed independent contractors, stating that they were free to send a substitute and that the company was under no obligation to offer, nor they to accept, work. In practice they worked regular hours, could not substitute, and were expected to be available. They claimed entitlement to the national minimum wage and paid annual leave as "workers" under the relevant regulations.',
    judgment:'The Supreme Court held that the valeters were workers entitled to statutory protection. The Employment Tribunal\'s assessment of the true working relationship was restored.',
    ratio:'In employment disputes, courts are not bound by the literal terms of a written contract where those terms do not reflect the true agreement between the parties. The court must ascertain the real relationship by examining how the parties actually conducted themselves. The inequality of bargaining power that typically exists between a business and an individual seeking work is a relevant contextual factor in determining whether contractual terms reflect genuine agreement or have been imposed.',

    title:'Foskett v McKeown [2000] UKHL 29',
    court:'House of Lords',
    facts:'Murphy misappropriated money from a group of purchasers and used part of it to pay the third and fourth annual premiums on a life assurance policy. He later committed suicide, triggering a death benefit of around £1 million payable under the policy. The dispute was between the purchasers, who claimed a proportionate share of the proceeds on the ground that their traceable funds had contributed to them, and Murphy\'s children, the named beneficiaries.',
    judgment:'The House of Lords (3:2) held that the purchasers were entitled to a proportionate share of the death benefit corresponding to the fraction of the total premiums paid with their misappropriated money.',
    ratio:'The right to trace property into its substitutes is a proprietary right arising from a pre-existing beneficial interest, not a personal claim for unjust enrichment. Where a beneficiary\'s assets are mixed with or used to augment other assets, the beneficiary acquires a proportionate beneficial interest in the augmented fund. The remedy is to vindicate an existing property right, and the quantification of that right follows arithmetically from the contribution of the traceable asset.',

  // ── 17. Evidence — case ──

    title:'Horncastle & Ors, R v [2009] UKSC 14',
    court:'UK Supreme Court',
    facts:'Each appellant had been convicted of a serious criminal offence where the prosecution\'s case relied significantly on a written statement from a witness who did not give oral evidence at trial. The European Court of Human Rights had ruled in Al-Khawaja v UK that convicting a defendant solely or to a decisive degree on the basis of such an untested statement violated Art 6 ECHR. The appellants argued their convictions were unsafe on the same basis.',
    judgment:'The Supreme Court dismissed all the appeals and declined to follow the ECtHR\'s "sole or decisive" rule, finding that the UK statutory hearsay regime under the Criminal Justice Act 2003 contained sufficient safeguards to ensure a fair trial.',
    ratio:'UK courts are obliged to take Strasbourg jurisprudence into account but are not bound by it, particularly where a Grand Chamber ruling has failed to appreciate a distinctive feature of domestic law. A higher domestic court may decline to follow an ECtHR decision and seek to resolve the divergence through dialogue rather than automatic compliance. The admissibility of hearsay evidence does not automatically breach Art 6 ECHR if the overall proceedings are fair and adequate counterbalancing safeguards exist.',

    court:'House of Lords',
    facts:'A 15-year-old boy on a bus repeatedly asked a 13-year-old girl to perform a sexual act. He was charged under s.1(1) Indecency with Children Act 1960 with inciting a child under 14 to commit an act of gross indecency. He claimed he had genuinely believed the girl was 14 or older. The magistrate convicted on the basis that the offence was one of strict liability in relation to the age element.',
    judgment:'The House of Lords allowed the appeal. An honest belief that the victim was 14 or over was a defence. The offence was not one of strict liability on the age element.',
    ratio:'The presumption that Parliament intends mens rea to be an element of a criminal offence (established in Sweet v Parsley) applies with full force unless Parliament has clearly and unambiguously created a strict liability offence. An honest belief, even if unreasonably held, is sufficient to negative the mental element and provide a defence. The court must look to the language, subject matter and object of the statute to determine whether Parliament has displaced the presumption.',

    title:'Uber BV & Ors v Aslam & Ors [2021] UKSC 5',
    court:'UK Supreme Court',
    facts:'Drivers using the Uber app claimed they were "workers" entitled to the minimum wage and paid holiday under the Employment Rights Act 1996, despite written agreements casting them as self-employed contractors transacting directly with passengers. Uber set the fares, dictated the terms and controlled how drivers performed.',
    judgment:'The Supreme Court unanimously held the drivers were workers, and were working whenever they were signed in to the app and ready to accept trips in their area.',
    ratio:'Worker status is decided by the statutory purpose of protecting vulnerable workers, applied to the practical reality of the relationship — not the labels in the contract. Where one party dictates the terms and the other is in a subordinate, dependent position, the court looks through the documents to the substance of the bargain.',

    facts:'Zambian villagers sued a UK-domiciled parent company and its Zambian mining subsidiary in the English courts over pollution, raising whether England was the proper place to try the claim and whether a parent could owe a duty of care for its subsidiary’s operations.',
    judgment:'The Supreme Court allowed the claim to proceed in England, holding it was arguable that the parent owed a relevant duty of care.',
    ratio:'There is no distinct category of parent-company liability; ordinary negligence principles apply. A parent may owe a duty to those harmed by its subsidiary where, in fact, it took over or held itself out as exercising supervision and control of the relevant operations — the question turns on the degree of intervention, not corporate structure.',

    judgment:'The Supreme Court held there was no unlawful discrimination: the objection was to the message, not to the customer or any protected characteristic.',
    ratio:'Refusing to produce a message with which one profoundly disagrees is not discrimination against the person who requested it, where the objection is to the message itself and would apply whoever asked. Compelling a person to express a belief they reject engages their Convention rights to freedom of thought, conscience and expression.',

    judgment:'The Supreme Court held a binding contract existed and the agent was entitled to his commission.',
    ratio:'A contract is not void for uncertainty merely because a term is left unstated; a court may imply what the parties must have intended so as to give the agreement business efficacy. Where the parties plainly intended to be bound and have acted on their bargain, courts are slow to strike it down as too uncertain to enforce.',

    facts:'A claimant in the public eye sought to restrain publication of details of an extramarital sexual encounter. The material had already circulated online and in publications abroad, and the newspaper argued an injunction could no longer serve any purpose.',
    judgment:'The Supreme Court, by a majority, continued the injunction pending trial.',

Privacy, unlike confidence, is not necessarily destroyed by limited prior disclosure, and there is a qualitative difference between scattered online material and front-page print.',

  { id:'m6', type:'curated', cat:'case-law', area:'Employment',
    title:'Pimlico Plumbers Ltd & Anor v Smith [2018] UKSC 29',
    court:'UK Supreme Court',
    facts:'A plumber engaged on ostensibly self-employed terms — VAT-registered and providing his own tools, but working solely for the company under its rules and branding — claimed he was in fact a worker entitled to associated rights.',
    judgment:'The Supreme Court unanimously upheld the tribunal’s conclusion that he was a worker.',
    ratio:'Worker status depends on whether the individual undertook to perform the work personally and whether the counterparty was a client or customer of a business run by the individual. A narrow, fettered right of substitution — limited to colleagues bound on similar terms — is consistent with an obligation of personal performance.',
